    <img class="Eye" src="eye1.jpg" alt="Eye image">
    <p class="principal-project-text">Project pertains to the concept of preliminary detection of Posterior Capsular Opacification, Glaucoma and Genetic Diseases in the human eye using AlexNet, which is one of the most early CNN. Conventional neural
      networks  are trained with specific layers using the given dataset taking blood vessels as the parameter for detecting the defects from the images. The specific layers are used for reducing the time for training and detection. The layers have
      been chosen based on the different parameters like filters, rate of training, initial rate, statistical parameters and mathematical modelling. After this the system is trained for 100 to 1000 epochs in which the test image is chosen as input
      and is compared with the healthy and unhealthy blood vessels. It is found that for first training the system had a detection with an accuracy of 50 to 60% and with subsequent training it had an efficiency of 70-80%.

    <p class="existtext">In the nearest future this work can contribute to the medical image processing technology in an efficient way. This work can be extended to a fully engaged medical start-up for analysing and detection of the diseases in human
      eyes.
      Also it can provide a lot of assistance in the rural areas if it can be integrated with any automated system for capturing eye fundus images for preliminary detection of eye ailments.
